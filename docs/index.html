        <p>So this is the follow up to a follow up. I&rsquo;ve been writing Clojure more or less professionally for about a year now, and I just re-read <a href="http://lfn3.net/2015/02/15/fresh-thoughts-on-dependency-injection/">my old thoughts on Dependency Injection</a>. Once again, it having been more than 6 months, my opinions have changed.
The reasons I used dependency injection in C# don&rsquo;t affect me nearly as badly in Clojure, so the amount I use it has vastly decreased, and the way and reasons I use it have changed.</p>

        So a little while ago (ok, a couple of months ago now.) I quit my job at Ubquity in favour of one at LiveOps. There were a bunch of reasons for that, but you&rsquo;ll have to buy me a beer to get those out of me. The main draw though, was being able to work with Clojure instead of C# (Hence the punny title). There&rsquo;s a lot of posts about why and how companies moved to Clojure but not so many about individuals - I guess we don&rsquo;t really make good marketing pieces?

        <p>This is essentially a follow up to an earlier post <a href="http://lfn3.net/2014/09/18/dependency-injection-a-necessary-evil/">Dependency Injection - A necessary evil?</a>,  from back when I had more reservations about using DI, and the benefits it gave me. I&rsquo;ve since been fully converted to a &lsquo;believer&rsquo;. This post is bascially about why and how I think that happened.</p>

        <p>So if you&rsquo;ve been here before (highly unlikely, I know), you might have noticed this place might have previously looked almost entirely different. There&rsquo;s reasons for that. I got somewhat frustrated with my existing cobbled together solution of python scripts, so I had a bit of a look around and found this nice new-ish project (in Go, which is an important factor for me, I like to be able to stare into the guts of the things I use.) called <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It seems to support pretty much everything I want it to, which is super. And it&rsquo;s also relatively simple in terms of what it expects from the user, which is also great.</p>

        <p><em>Basically my position on DI has since changed - go take a look at <a href="http://lfn3.net/2015/02/14/fresh-thoughts-on-dependency-injection/">Fresh Thoughts on Dependency Injection</a></em></p>

<p>So first of all, to preface this and so you get a little bit of insight from where I&rsquo;m coming from, I spend most of my days toiling in the great C# mine, so lovingly provided by Microsoft. I used to be a python guy, and I&rsquo;ve gotten dangerous with Go, and am trying to do so with Clojure. The clojure thing is recent, so this might be a bit more cargo culty than I&rsquo;d like. Anyway.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mar 12 2013</span>
        <p>So I spent a good chunk of today messing around with making a few icons for use on this site. Which was&hellip; interesting. There isn&rsquo;t really a heck of a lot of information out there about how to do this, or at least nothing that google turned up. I managed to cobble something together though. And now hopefully reading this will save you all that effort.</p>

        <p><em>This post is hideously out of date. Go take a look at <a href="http://lfn3.net/2015/02/14/moving-to-hugo-and-lanyon/">Moving to Hugo and Lanyon</a> for the lowdown on way this site works now</em></p>

<p>So. I&rsquo;d written two posts in anticipation of getting this up and running, however they proved to be glouriously incorrect. I&rsquo;ve been through about three or four changes in terms of how I actually decided to do this, so&hellip; yeah.</p>

<p>Anyway, at this point, it&rsquo;s a site that&rsquo;s built from <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a> templates. Mostly. In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, some bits of it are still not yet entirely working. Mostly the contact page. And all the examples I need to throw on the page that&rsquo;s supposed to convince you to pay me. Which is just a little bit awkward.</p>
