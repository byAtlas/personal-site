  <h1 class="post-title">Performance checks on metrics</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Apr 24 2017</span>
  <p>At <a href="https://www.lmax.com/">LMAX</a> we do <a href="https://www.symphonious.net/testing-at-lmax/">a lot of automated testing</a>, including running several
dedicated environments for performance testing. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of specific
numbers that come out of these environments that we surface on dashboards like
this:</p>

<p><img src="http://lfn3.net/img/posts/performance-checks-on-metrics/perf-dashboard.png" alt="perf-dashboard" /></p>

<p>But we also collect a bunch of other metrics from our servers and services that,
until recently, we didn&rsquo;t have much visibility over.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Rediscovering these lost numbers started with us deploying a service with debug
logging we were using to investigate intermittency to production.
This gave some of our web servers a hard time, since they were logging lots more
on certain types of requests. It didn&rsquo;t have a huge impact, but it
was definitely something we noticed, and didn&rsquo;t really want to repeat.
Especially since it took longer than we would have liked to trace the performance
problems back to the additional logging.</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing you can&rsquo;t really catch with the approach we use to
cover our really performance sensitive code paths, which is a combination of
replaying events and JMH micro-benchmarking. This is not because you wouldn&rsquo;t
actually be able to catch a performance regression with these tools, but because
the time and effort we would expend. Covering everything that might possibly cause
a performance problem at some point in the future with a JMH benchmark would
probably double our already significant number of tests. Not to mention that it
would massively increase how long our tests take to run.</p>

<p>So we decided needed something to cover more ground. Turns out that we already
had the data we needed, we just weren&rsquo;t actually making decisions based on it.
We collect a <em>lot</em> of information from all of our environments, for example
one of our CI environments has around 600,000 metrics that have had numbers
against them across all of it&rsquo;s servers. There&rsquo;s a ton of potentially useful
information in there: GC pause times, open file handles, as well as more
application specific stuff.</p>

<p>We do surface all of that in some pretty (basic) graphs:
<img src="http://lfn3.net/img/posts/performance-checks-on-metrics/jodie.png" alt="jodie" />
These do get used when we&rsquo;re troubleshooting, and can generate alerts in our
production monitoring. But we haven&rsquo;t really exploited them fully for our
testing cycle.</p>

<p>The open file handles we&rsquo;d already used in a check on some of our reporting
services, since we&rsquo;d had issues with those not cleaning up after
themselves. We thought we&rsquo;d take that and riff on it a little
for other numbers.</p>

<p>Our goal was to &ldquo;catch regressions in unexpected places&rdquo;, so we took
a bunch of system and jvm level metrics we thought might be applicable:
GC Pause times, running proc count, and load average. We picked these since
they&rsquo;re some of the more general performance indicators we could think of.
That&rsquo;s good since we&rsquo;re looking to catch any and all regressions, rather than
target anything application specific.</p>

<p>Essentially all we did was pick the average or maximum for these values out of our
metric store, and compare it to a number in our checker. We set some overrides
for specific values on specific services, since we expect some of our services
like the exchange to use a lot more resources than say our web app servers.</p>

<p>Of course we wanted to prove this would have actually caught the problem that
kicked all this off, so we ran these tests over the metrics we collected from
the dodgy build to verify that it would have failed if they were in place.
In that case, the load average check did fail due to all the additional string
processing we were doing.</p>

<p>These checks are pretty crude at the moment. We&rsquo;re hoping they&rsquo;ll be effective
in the long run, but if they aren&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s fine. Crude measures can be refined,
but things you aren&rsquo;t looking at are never gonna be improved. Of course if we
figure out at some point these checks are causing us more pain than they&rsquo;re
saving us, we&rsquo;ll look at finding another solution.</p>

<p>We did try some mildly fancy stuff involving doing a regression over the data to
check if we were leaking resources over time, but our acceptance style (involving
hardware and topology pretty close to our production environments) perf test
runs take on the order of half an hour, which isn&rsquo;t really long enough to produce
an alertable trend.</p>

<p>This process also delivered some value in another way. In the process of setting
overrides for our services, we discovered that some of them were experiencing
longer GC pauses than we would like. Again, these are off the path we have
pretty well covered. None of them are at panic inducing levels, but some are
definitely at moderate concern inducing levels, and something we&rsquo;re digging into.</p>

<p>Hopefully this showed you a little bit of our process for dealing with issues we
encounter. Not so much the actual finding and fixing part, but more the making
sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again part. Also you should go take a look at some of the
numbers you&rsquo;re collecting from your testing environments, or if you&rsquo;re not
collecting any, start. Since if you aren&rsquo;t measuring a thing, it&rsquo;s near
impossible to improve it.</p>
