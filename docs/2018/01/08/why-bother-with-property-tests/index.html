  <h1 class="post-title">Why bother with property tests</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Jan 8 2018</span>
  <p>So something I&rsquo;ve been trying to do lately is write more property or generative tests. I&rsquo;ve been spending a bit of time
thinking about why we&rsquo;re actually doing this. Obviously I think it&rsquo;s a good idea, but what actual benefits do we get
from these, apart from slightly more arcane tests?</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-property-test-anyway">What is a property test anyway?</h3>

<p>Just in case you&rsquo;re not sure what a property based test is, it&rsquo;s a test where rather than specifying the input and
output, e.g. <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>, instead get the computer to generate the input for you, and validate a more abstract property
of the thing that you&rsquo;re testing. For example: <code>x &lt; x + y</code>. They&rsquo;re also known as generative tests.</p>

<p>Hopefully that shows they&rsquo;re a little more complicated to write (the above example isn&rsquo;t even correct unless we ignore
negative numbers), but I&rsquo;m going to spend the rest of this post explaining why I think they&rsquo;re worth writing despite the
extra effort you have to put in.</p>

<h3 id="increases-your-confidence-in-your-code">Increases your confidence in your code</h3>

<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve learned over the few years I&rsquo;ve spent programming is that I&rsquo;m wrong <em>a lot</em>. Sometimes in obvious
ways that a compiler will catch and tell me about nearly instantly, other times in ways that I have to go and dig at or
write tests to figure out. Even when I write tests to cover whatever code I just came up with, I&rsquo;m never actually sure
that I&rsquo;ve written all of the tests I need to. Property based tests go some way towards alleviating this fear, since I
no longer have to worry about covering every individual case, but rather just each class of test.</p>

<p>Unless you can encode the logic you&rsquo;re testing in a different way for the test (that&rsquo;s obviously correct!), or you have
an oracle of some kind to check against in your property test, you&rsquo;re still going to have to write at least one example
based test. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t really be sure that the code does exactly what you expect it to (and that it will
continue to do so).</p>

<p>If you do have an oracle to check against, even one that&rsquo;s only good for a subset of the inputs, that&rsquo;s great! You&rsquo;re
probably in a position to be super lazy, and might be able to get away with writing only a property single test for
the function you&rsquo;re testing. Which brings me nicely to my next point:</p>

<h3 id="you-re-lazy-and-that-s-not-a-bad-thing">You&rsquo;re lazy, and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really love writing tests. For me they&rsquo;re very much a means to an end, in that they help me write code more
correctly, faster. Unit tests, in particular, I question the lasting value of quite a bit. More often than not all
they tell you when they break is that you changed some code. I think property tests give you more bang for you buck,
since usually you  have to make the assertions general enough that they reflect the essence of the function you&rsquo;re testing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a big fan of making the computer do as much work as possible or at least practical. If you use a good property
testing library, it&rsquo;ll automatically pick out commonly problematic test cases, e.g. -1 and 0 if you&rsquo;re using numbers,
or &ldquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ã­&rdquo; for strings. It should also hit the edges of any boundaries you specify fairly quickly, so if you request
a number in the range 25 - 75, you should see the library emit the values 25 and 75 during any given test run. This
means you don&rsquo;t need to worry about the boundary conditions, since they&rsquo;ll already be covered.</p>

<p>In addition, there&rsquo;s some kinds of tests where you don&rsquo;t really care too much about the mechanics of what happens,
you&rsquo;re just looking to check some invariant is preserved. For example, serialization and deserialization. In this case,
the actual values we pass in to be serialized are not really important to the test, so we can use a property testing
library to reflect over the method, and feed it arbitrary generated values.</p>

<h3 id="they-go-great-with-contracts">They go <em>great</em> with contracts</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the opinion that one of the best things you can do to make your system more robust is adding contracts to check
the data that flows through your code. Even if you don&rsquo;t enable them at runtime (or only enable them at the borders of
your system) they greatly help you confirm the consistency of your system in a way that less advanced type systems
can otherwise struggle with. Little things like being able to say that a particular value with never be negative,
throughout your entire system are great. They let you focus on the actual problems you have to solve, rather than
worrying about the providence of a particular bit of data.</p>

<p>If you then write some simple generative tests at the borders of your system (they don&rsquo;t have to assert anything,
apart from the fact they don&rsquo;t get an error as their response) you can be relatively certain that you don&rsquo;t violate the
constraints you&rsquo;ve specified inside your codebase.</p>

<h3 id="helps-you-find-the-actual-boundaries-of-your-system">Helps you find the (actual) boundaries of your system</h3>

<p>The first property test you write for any bit of code doesn&rsquo;t even have to have assertions, just calling your code and
making sure it doesn&rsquo;t explode is enough. The great thing about this test is it&rsquo;s always good. At most, you just need to
adjust the ranges in your generator when you change the code under test.</p>

<p>When it does explode on some input that you didn&rsquo;t count on getting, you&rsquo;ll adjust the generator to not emit those values.
At the same time you should step further up the stack, towards where your customers interact with the system, and write
a test to make sure that your function can&rsquo;t be invoked with these values.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t actually much different from the point above about contracts, it&rsquo;s just that the contracts here are implicit
rather than explicit.</p>

<h3 id="you-have-to-think-more">You have to think more</h3>

<p>This is the reason I got into programming. Sometimes it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em>, and you have to spend a while noodling on a problem
before you can make a reasonable attack on it. Often, figuring out the properties to write is one of those hard things.
I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a bad thing. Personally I&rsquo;m far more prone to under thinking a particular bit of code than
over thinking it, and anything that makes me slow down a bit and worry about what the code is actually supposed to be
doing is probably a good thing.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the unrealized or underrated advantages of TDD, that you spend more time thinking about what the
code does and how it does it. Often having read the code I just wrote is enough to make me discover there&rsquo;s something in
need of correction. Property testing has the same effect, just more of it.</p>

<h3 id="make-impractical-tests-possible">Make impractical tests possible.</h3>

<p>Would you write a test that performs 17 different sequenced actions? Probably not unless you already knew there was a
bug there, right? If you dive into writing stateful tests, you won&rsquo;t have to write the 17 action test, your property
testing library will do it for you. In systems where correctness is important and there&rsquo;s lots of state to cover this
is one of the only ways to get this sort of coverage, short of using production workloads.</p>

<p>These sorts of tests really amplify the &ldquo;have to think more&rdquo; aspect, since you have to manipulate your system through a
sequence of valid states, and find some properties to actually assert on that hold over the lifecycle of your systen.
Other people have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q">explained</a> how to do this, so if it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re
interested in I&rsquo;d suggest you take a look at their efforts.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h3>

<p>Property based tests are harder to write than unit tests. Sometimes, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to spend more time
writing them than you would for an equivalent amount of coverage with unit tests. Other times, that extra effort can let
you test things that wouldn&rsquo;t be practical or possible without property tests. Finally, while writing these tests, you
often discover that the edges of valid input aren&rsquo;t where you thought they would be, either because of the contracts
you wrote, or the implicit contracts of the language or code you&rsquo;re using. If correctness is important to you and your
application&rsquo;s users, I would highly recommend you put some effort into writing property tests for your system.</p>
