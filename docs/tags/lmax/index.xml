      <title>Where the GC Fears to Tread</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmax.com&#34;&gt;LMAX Exchange&lt;/a&gt; our staging environment was having services killed frequently by the OOM killer.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; unusual, since our staging vms are relatively under-provisioned compared to our production environments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We have separate performance testing environments, with much beefier hardware for making sure we go fast, whereas the staging environments
exist more for testing our deployment and configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was irritating, since it led to a reasonable amount of toil on the part of both the dev and systems teams.
We eventually ended up figuring it out, but it was a bit of a journey.
All of the dev team was interested in it, so we begged, bothered and cajoled the whole story out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Palmr&#34;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt;,
who did most of the digging. I thought it was good enough to share with the world at large,
so I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced his presentation in blog form here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bitcoin crash course</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just moved to London, and been working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lmaxdigital.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX Digital&lt;/a&gt; and as a result been given
a bit of a crash course on how exactly Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) transactions actually work. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a
near zero chance I&amp;rsquo;m going to remember it as I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on to another area of work, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d better write it
all down before I forget it all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
