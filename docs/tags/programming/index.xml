      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve just started working with a new team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://bluecove.com&#34;&gt;BlueCove&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying it, especially since we have a lot of decision making space
to work with. The company has just turned one (there was cake, it was delicious)
and the process of building up the code we need is still in full swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something interesting happened to me the other day. I was talking with one of my
co-workers about a problem we were trying to solve, and was about to reach for
one of the terms from the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2TtXnGz&#34;&gt;Domain Driven Design (DDD)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
book, namely &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html&#34;&gt;Bounded Context&lt;/a&gt;
I asked him if he&amp;rsquo;d read the book, and he hadn&amp;rsquo;t. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about it
until I was on the tube home, and I was going over my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, I should give you a hefty disclaimer - I&amp;rsquo;m not any
sort of expert in what I&amp;rsquo;m about to write about. When I was explaining why I was
excited about writing this to my wife, she told me it sounded like I was writing
about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics&#34;&gt;Semantics&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted an
educational excursion through wikipedia. I am, however very willing to be wrong
on the internet, so let&amp;rsquo;s dig in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
