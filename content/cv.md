I've been writing code professionally for over a decade, and for a decade prior to that as a hobbyist and student.
I've been a polyglot programmer for the last four years, working in Python, Rust and Haskell, 
and interacting with all the parts of a starting up a boutique fixed income asset manager.
I've been able to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, and deliver on ambitious deadlines within an organisation that solves
problems with code rather than spreadsheets.

Prior to this, my work on the JVM has been in low latency, high performance environments, with experienced and effective teams.
As a part of these teams I've been able to leverage my skills and insights to help us deliver better code more quickly
and with fewer bugs, and continually improve my own and my team's work.

I'm passionate about developing, understanding and improving code, as well as helping others to do the same.
This has meant giving talks at local programming meetups, as well as internally at organizations I've worked with.
I've also tried to record some of my more fully formed thoughts on [my blog](https://lfn3.net/).
Recently, I've become interested in Rust, Go and OCaml, and explored many other libraries and 
programming techniques in the search for ways to produce better code.

At present I'm established in a permanent full-time programming role, but I would be open to discussing opportunities 
involving Rust and performance-oriented work. If your team is passionate about the craft of programming, 
can offer challenging problems, and contributes to open source, I would love to hear from you.
