I've been writing code professionally for 5 years, and for a decade prior to that as a hobbyist and student. During that
time I've worked with many object oriented and functional programming languages, such as Java, Clojure, C# and Python.
My work on the JVM has been in low latency, high performance environments, with experienced and effective teams.
As a part of these teams I've been able to leverage my skills and insights to help us deliver better code more quickly
and with fewer bugs, and continually improve my own and my team's work.

I'm passionate about developing, understanding and improving code, as well as helping others to do the same.
This has meant giving talks at local programming meetups, as well as internally at organizations I've been worked with.
I've also tried to record some of my more fully formed thoughts on [my blog](https://lfn3.net/).
Recently, I've become interested in Rust, Go and OCaml, and explored many other libraries and 
programming techniques in the search for ways to produce better code.

At present I'm established in a permanent full-time programming role, but I would be open to discussing opportunities 
involving functional programming and performance-oriented work. If your team is passionate about the craft of programming, 
can offer challenging problems, and contributes to open source, I would love to hear from you.
