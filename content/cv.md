I'm a 24-year-old developer. I've been writing code for almost 14 years now, beginning by learning C++ as a child and later switching to python, before picking up C# at my present employer. 

In my spare time I've been enthusiastically learning Go and Clojure, producing all sorts of odds and ends, some of which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/lfn3). Lately I've begun to put my learnings into words and hopefully impart some wisdom in the process, which you can take a look at on [this site](/).

I'm currently looking for some new, more challenging territory to conquer. Ideally this would involve rich clientside experiences driven by bleeding edge Javascript frameworks and tooling, backed by carefully honed APIs.

I'd like to work alongside a team that's as passionate about the craft of programming as I am. With this (your?) team, I want to solve challenging problems with elegant solutions, drawing on and sharing knowledge both within the company and with the wider community of developers.
