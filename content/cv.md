I'm a 25-year-old developer. I've been writing code for almost 15 years now, beginning by learning C++ as a child and later switching to python, before picking up C# at my previous employer. At the moment I'm writing (and loving) Clojure full-time, after dabbling with it for several years in my spare time.

Previously in my spare time I spent some time learning Go, producing all sorts of odds and ends, some of which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/lfn3). Lately I've begun to put my learnings into words and hopefully impart some wisdom in the process, which you can take a look at on [this site](/). I've also been organizing the local [Clojure meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Clojure/), putting together talks and workshops.

At present I'm not actively looking for new opportunities, but if your company is using Clojure and/or Clojurescript in production, think your team is as passionate about the craft of programming as I am, can offer challenging problems, and regularly contribute back to open source, feel free to get in touch.
