I've been writing code for almost 15 years now, beginning by learning C++ as a child and later switching to Python, 
before picking up C# at my previous employer. I've worked on Clojure and Java in high performance, low latency environments.
I'm passionate and curious about developing optimizing and understanding code.

Previously in my spare time I spent some time learning Go, producing all sorts of odds and ends, some of which can be 
found on [Github](https://github.com/lfn3). Lately I've begun to put my learnings into words and hopefully impart some 
wisdom in the process, which you can take a look at on [this site](/). I've also been organizing the local 
[Clojure meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Clojure/), putting together talks and workshops.

I'm not actively looking for new opportunities, but I would be open to anything involving functional programming on the 
JVM, and performance oriented work. If you think your team is passionate about the craft of programming, can offer 
challenging problems, and contributes back to open source, please to get in touch.
