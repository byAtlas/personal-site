If you've ever met me in person, I've almost certainly told you that I've been working on a property testing library.
Which on the face of it, seems kinda ridiculous. It's not like I don't have options already for the programming 
languages I use, in fact I wrote a whole [thing]({{< ref "property-testing-tooling-in-java.md" >}}) about the options 
for Java. The answer's kinda at the end of that blog post - I saw that there was a better way of doing this, with
[hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works) or something like it.

Undertaker is my attempt to make that.
